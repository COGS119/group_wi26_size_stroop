  // here's how we can construct a simple size stroop judgment trial
  // TO DO: Hm, there's quite a lot of whitespace below the image slide, making the prompt appear far below it. Maybe that could be improved?
  // OTHER TO DOs: what else do we need to add to the trial procedure? What other information should we store? How can we turn this into a complete experiment timeline?
